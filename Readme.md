## Short Report

Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and R3 Corda represent different blockchain paradigms. **Ethereum** is a public blockchain using **Proof of Stake**, offering decentralized, open participation but lower throughput (~30 TPS). It supports smart contracts in **Solidity** and has a native token (**ETH**), making it ideal for DApps.

**Hyperledger Fabric** is a private blockchain with **pluggable consensus** and high throughput (1000+ TPS). It supports smart contracts in **Go/JavaScript** but has no native token. Its **permissioned model** and privacy via **channels** suit enterprise use cases like **supply chain networks**.

**R3 Corda**, a consortium blockchain, emphasizes privacy and scalability. It uses a **notary mechanism** instead of traditional consensus and allows smart contracts in **JVM languages**. With no native token, it suits **financial applications** among known entities.

- For a **decentralized app**, Ethereum is best due to its open nature and smart contract ecosystem.  
- For a **supply chain among known partners**, Hyperledger Fabric provides speed and privacy.  
- For **inter-bank applications**, R3 Corda is optimal, offering secure, permissioned, point-to-point data sharing.
